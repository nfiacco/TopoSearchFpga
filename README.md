### README

It's been a long time since I worked on this project in school, but I'm still proud of it. I'm
not sure I could even get it up and running again if I wanted to...

The code was written in VHDL, and describes a circuit that can be used to solve shortest path
problems on topographical maps. It also includes the circuitry to display a graphical
representation of the problem and solution. Very pretty, although I don't have any videos to
show.

At some point, I might try to get my hands on an FPGA and attempt to program it.

P.S. please forgive the naming of some of the files.
